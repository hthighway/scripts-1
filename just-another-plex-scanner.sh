# Run this with flock on cron, as often as you like.

### ATTENTION: You could run this script on a different (e.g. Plexdrive 5) mount in order to minimize stress on main mount.
###            Later in this script you would replace the path of the temp mount with the main mount path, so that Plex finds the files.
###            If you don't care about the stress on your main mount, you can ignore this comment.
